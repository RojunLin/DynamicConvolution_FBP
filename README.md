# Attribute-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Facial Beauty Prediction

Attribute-Aware Convolutional Neural Network (AaConv-Net) is a dynamic CNN architecture to integrate the aesthetic-related attribute information that promotes the performance of facial beauty prediction finally.

## Versions
There are two options for implementing AaConv-Net, including Caffe and Pytorch versions.
BTW, Pytorch version is coming soon...
